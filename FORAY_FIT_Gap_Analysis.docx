1\. Executive Summary

This gap analysis compares Treasury\'s Office of Financial Innovation
and Transformation (FIT) blockchain grant management prototype with
FORAY Protocol to identify enhancement opportunities that could
strengthen federal grant fraud prevention---particularly relevant given
the ongoing Minnesota fraud investigation involving an estimated \$9
billion in misappropriated federal funds.

**Key Finding:** The FIT prototype provides excellent fund tracking and
drawdown visibility. FORAY Protocol could serve as a complementary
semantic layer that adds transaction structure verification,
privacy-preserving audit capabilities, and service delivery
validation---addressing fraud patterns where payments are made for
services never rendered.

2\. Treasury FIT Blockchain Prototype Overview

2.1 Initiative Background

In summer 2019, Treasury\'s Bureau of the Fiscal Service launched a
proof-of-concept with the National Science Foundation (NSF) to explore
blockchain technology for federal grant management. The initiative has
since expanded to include demonstrations for HUD, Commerce, and HHS.

2.2 Prototype Capabilities

-   **Tokenized Grant Awards:** Digital representation of grant awards
    containing descriptive information, terms, and funding amounts

-   **Real-Time Fund Tracking:** Visibility into fund transfers from
    federal agency → prime recipient → subrecipient

-   **Internal Controls:** Prime grantees can create funding thresholds
    within blockchain tokens

-   **Automated Reporting:** Users can generate federal financial
    reports and review payment status at any point

-   **Transaction History:** Every transaction recorded and viewable by
    authorized participants

2.3 JFMIP Multi-Agency Expansion

In August 2021, the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program
(JFMIP) expanded the FIT prototype across agency boundaries to GAO. The
December 2023 report \"Harnessing Blockchain in the Federal Government\"
documented key considerations for multi-agency blockchain deployment,
including IT infrastructure, cybersecurity, and Authority to Operate
(ATO) processes.

4\. Critical Gap: Service Delivery Verification

The Minnesota fraud investigation reveals a fundamental weakness in
current grant oversight: payments were made for services never rendered.
Feeding Our Future submitted fake meal counts; child care centers
claimed attendance for children not present; behavioral health providers
billed for services without documentation.

4.1 How FIT Prototype Addresses This

The FIT prototype tracks fund flows but does not inherently verify that
claimed services were delivered. A fraudulent provider could still
submit false claims; the blockchain would accurately record the
resulting payment, but would not flag the underlying fraud.

4.2 How FORAY Protocol Addresses This

FORAY\'s 4-component model creates explicit linkage between service
delivery (Accruals) and payments (Actions):

-   **Arrangement:** Grant agreement with terms (e.g., \"\$5.00 per meal
    served to eligible children\")

-   **Accrual:** Service delivery record with formula (e.g., \"150
    children × 2 meals × \$5.00 = \$1,500\")

-   **Anticipation:** Expected reimbursement based on accrued services

-   **Action:** Actual payment---must reference verified Accruals

**Any payment (Action) without corresponding service delivery (Accrual)
is immediately flagged as anomalous.** Fraudulent invoices cannot be
anchored without creating the verifiable service delivery records that
would expose the fraud.

5\. Recommendations

5.1 FORAY as Semantic Layer

FORAY Protocol should be positioned as a complementary semantic layer
that enhances (rather than replaces) Treasury\'s blockchain
infrastructure. The FIT prototype provides the anchoring mechanism;
FORAY provides the transaction structure and verification logic.

5.2 Pilot Program Proposal

A 6-month pilot integrating FORAY transaction semantics with the FIT
prototype could demonstrate fraud prevention value for programs similar
to those affected by Minnesota fraud (Child Nutrition, Child Care
Assistance, Behavioral Health).

5.3 Next Steps

-   Request technical briefing with FIT team to discuss integration
    approach

-   Develop mapping between FIT token structure and FORAY components

-   Identify pilot program with willing state agency partner
