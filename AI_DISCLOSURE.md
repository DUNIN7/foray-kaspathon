## Overview

This project was developed collaboratively with AI assistance. Per Kaspathon 2026 requirements, this document details where and how AI was used throughout the development process.

**AI Tool Used:** Claude (Anthropic)

---

## How AI Was Used

### 1. Protocol Design & Architecture

- **Brainstorming** the 4-component model (Arrangements, Accruals, Anticipations, Actions)
- **Refining** v4.1 features (flexible entry points, many-to-many references)
- **Privacy architecture** discussions (salted formula IDs, instance pools, obfuscated references)
- **Identifying** edge cases and transaction patterns

### 2. Documentation

- **Drafting** protocol specifications (FORAY_Protocol_v4_1_Specification.md)
- **Writing** integration guides (QuickBooks, Salesforce)
- **Creating** sector guides (Energy, Financial Services, Auditor/Advisory, Manufacturing, Defense)
- **Creating** README.md and project documentation
- **Iterative editing** based on author review and feedback

### 3. Code & Demo Tools

- **Generating** HTML/JavaScript for Transaction Review Tool
- **Creating** interactive infographic
- **Building** JSON validation logic
- **Iterative debugging** and refinement

### 4. Example Transactions

- **Creating** realistic JSON examples across industries:
  - Financial services (RMBS, FX spot, overnight repo)
  - Manufacturing (work orders, BOM)
  - Commercial (invoices, batch payments)
  - Energy (solar PPA)
- **Ensuring** schema compliance and internal consistency

### 5. Project Management

- **Version control** guidance (Git workflow)
- **File organization** and naming conventions
- **Packaging** for submission

## What AI Did NOT Do

- **Domain expertise** â€” The author provided accounting, audit, and financial services knowledge
- **Strategic decisions** â€” Protocol positioning, target markets, and business model decisions were made by the author
- **Kaspa integration choices** â€” Blockchain selection and technical rationale came from the author
- **Final review** â€” All materials were reviewed and approved by the author before publication

---

## Development Process

The project was developed through iterative conversation:

1. Author describes requirements or problem
2. AI generates draft content or code
3. Author reviews, critiques, and requests changes
4. AI refines based on feedback
5. Repeat until satisfactory

This collaborative process typically involved multiple revision cycles per deliverable.

## Transparency Statement

The author believes AI assistance is a legitimate and valuable tool for accelerating development, similar to using IDEs, documentation, or Stack Overflow. The intellectual foundation, domain expertise, and critical judgment remain human contributions.

All AI-generated content was reviewed, edited, and approved by the author before inclusion in this project.
