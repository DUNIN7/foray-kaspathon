Executive Summary

The Opportunity

Treasury\'s Office of Financial Innovation and Transformation (FIT) has
developed a blockchain-based grant payment prototype that provides
real-time fund tracking and automated reporting. FORAY Protocol offers a
complementary semantic layer that could enhance this infrastructure with
structured transaction verification, privacy-preserving audit
capabilities, and service delivery validation.

The Urgency: Minnesota Fraud Crisis

Federal prosecutors estimate \$9 billion in fraud across 14
Minnesota-administered programs. The common pattern: payments made for
services never rendered. Current systems track fund flows but cannot
verify that claimed services actually occurred. FORAY\'s transaction
semantic model addresses this gap by requiring explicit linkage between
service delivery records and payment authorizations.

Key Differentiators

  ----------------------- -----------------------------------------------
  **Capability**          **FORAY Enhancement**

  **4A Transaction        Structured lifecycle: Arrangements → Accruals →
  Model**                 Anticipations → Actions

  **Selective             Show auditors what they need; protect
  Disclosure**            beneficiary privacy

  **Cross-System Audit**  Unified trail across federal agencies, state
                          systems, and grantee ERPs
  ----------------------- -----------------------------------------------

Proposed Collaboration

We propose a 6-month pilot integrating FORAY transaction semantics with
Treasury\'s blockchain infrastructure, targeting a single grant program
with fraud prevention as the primary success metric.

Technical Alignment

Integration Architecture

FORAY Protocol is designed as a semantic layer that operates above
blockchain infrastructure. It does not replace Treasury\'s blockchain
investment---it enhances it with structured transaction verification.

Privacy Architecture for Beneficiary Protection

Grant programs serving vulnerable populations (children, disabled
individuals, healthcare recipients) require privacy protections.
FORAY\'s 3-layer privacy architecture ensures beneficiary data never
appears on-chain while maintaining audit verifiability:

1.  **Identifier Hashing:** Beneficiary identifiers are salted and
    hashed before anchoring. The salt is stored off-chain with access
    controls.

2.  **Formula Commitments:** Service delivery formulas (e.g., \"children
    × meals × rate\") are committed as hashes. Auditors can verify
    formula correctness without seeing individual records.

3.  **Instance Pooling:** Multiple transactions are batched before
    anchoring, preventing timing analysis that could identify specific
    beneficiaries.

**GDPR/Privacy Compliance:** Because personally identifiable information
(PII) is stored only off-chain with encryption, FORAY supports
\"practical erasure\" for compliance with data protection requirements.
Deleting off-chain records and encryption keys renders on-chain hashes
meaningless.

About FORAY Protocol

Protocol Overview

FORAY Protocol (derived from \"4A\" -- Arrangements, Accruals,
Anticipations, Actions) is an open-source transaction semantic standard
for enterprise audit trails. It provides a blockchain-agnostic framework
for creating immutable, privacy-preserving records of business
transactions.

The 4A Transaction Model

-   **Arrangements:** Contractual relationships defining parties, terms,
    and conditions

-   **Accruals:** Formulas applied against asset flows (e.g., service
    delivery calculations)

-   **Anticipations:** Expected future flows based on accrued values

-   **Actions:** Executed settlements with references to verified
    components

Key Features

-   **Blockchain-Agnostic:** Works with Kaspa, Ethereum, Hyperledger,
    AWS QLDB, or traditional databases with hash verification

-   **Privacy-Preserving:** 3-layer architecture with selective
    disclosure for auditors

-   **ERP Integration:** Production-ready adapters for SAP, Oracle,
    QuickBooks, Salesforce

-   **Compliance-Ready:** Designed for SOX 404, DCAA, Basel III, and
    GDPR requirements

Open Source Availability

FORAY Protocol is released under the Business Source License with full
transparency. The complete specification, reference implementation, and
integration adapters are available on GitHub. Government agencies may
use FORAY without licensing fees.

Current Status

-   **Protocol Version:** 4.1 (January 2026)

-   **Demonstration:** Live demo available at foray.dunin7.com

-   **Documentation:** Complete technical specification, sector guides
    (Financial Services, Defense, Manufacturing, Energy)

-   **Hackathon Submission:** Kaspathon 2026 Real-Time Data Track
